## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean text: remove stopwords, lemmatize, lowercase
   - Handle missing values
   - Tokenization & vectorization (TF-IDF / Word2Vec)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Top tags, most viewed talks
   - Word clouds and bar plots

3. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Content-Based Filtering using Cosine Similarity
   - Semantic Search using Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe)
   - Optional: Topic modeling with LDA for topic-aware suggestions
